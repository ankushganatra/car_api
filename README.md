# Cars API
## Instructions

In this exercise, your job is to build a simple API/webservice that expose one single endpoint called `/cars` that receives a GET with the location parameter as the example below:

GET /cars?location=51.5444204,-0.22707

This endpoint should fetch the 10 closest cars from the database and return them ordered by distance from the point receive. See the following snippet of a valid response:

````json
{
    "cars": [
      {
        "description": "West Ealing - Hartington Rd",
        "latitude": 51.511318,
        "longitude": -0.318178
      },
      {
        "description": "Sudbury - Williams Way",
        "latitude": 51.553667,
        "longitude": -0.315159
      },
      {
        "description": "West Ealing - St Leonardâ€™s Rd",
        "latitude": 51.512107,
        "longitude": -0.313599
      }
    ]
}
````

Running the code: 

Setting up DB: 

For the technology stack: MongoDB, Sinatra are used to implement the solution. You can update the MongoDB URL from config/environment.rb 


Run the app: 

Once you do bundle install, you can run the application by command `rackup config.ru` or `shotgun config.ru`

DB Seed: 
Assuming the app is running on localhost:9393, you can seed the data with following commnad executed on other terminal

thor db_seed:dump_json "http://localhost:9393/public/data.json"



Testing Result: 
Once the data is inserted in DB you can verify results from below URL 

http://localhost:9393/cars?location=51.5444204,-0.22707

View per page.
http://localhost:9393/cars?location=51.5444204,-0.22707&page=0

(Again this is assuming you are running the application in local at port 9393)
